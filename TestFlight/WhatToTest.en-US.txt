- Fixed possible crash on refresh access token (usually happened on startup)
- Fixed big buttons background on light theme
- Comments with cards reformulated (I know, there's too much spacing, my bad, it's a WIP), they should not lag, blink nor jump around anymore.
- Load more comments fully working
- Auto scroll to highlighted comment
- Comment dedicated post view
- Fixed home taking you to r/home lol
- I didn't fix the bug that makes the subreddits list not load yet, I'm working on that ðŸ‘Œ
