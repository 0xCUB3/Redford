- Added posts box in Subreddits screen. Tap the box in a opened post to have a quick link to it (with a comment and votes number that doesn't work yet).
- Posts images now have adjustable height
- Image are now zoomable in lightbox (but it unzooms right afterwards like instagram for now)
- We upgraded the food we give to Oeste, our cat that inspired winston, so now he should develop the app quicker.
